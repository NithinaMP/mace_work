            The coconut tree is a member of the palm tree family and the only living species of the genus Cocos. The term "coconut"
             can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut.

            Coconuts offer health benefits including digestive support from fiber, immune system enhancement due to lauric acid and antioxidants, and bone health from minerals like manganese and phosphorus. They may also
